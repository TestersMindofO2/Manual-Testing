#Smoke Testing	Sanity Testing

1.	Smoke testing is a shallow and wide approach of testing	
    Sanity testing is a narrow and deep approach of testing
    
2.	Smoke testing is done to ensure that the build is good enough to be considered for carrying on full-fledged testing	
    Sanity testing is done to ensure that after a new fix the particular component is working fine
    
3.	We usually have documented smoke tests i.e. there are some tests identified as smoke tests. These are tests are usually(preferably) automated	
    Sanity tests are generally not automated or even documented as test cases
    
4.	Smoke checks the overall components of the system
